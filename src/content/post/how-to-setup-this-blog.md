Hey everyone! I’m excited to share how I set up this blog.  
As a developer, I wanted a blog that’s fast, customizable, and easy to maintain.  
In this post, I’ll walk you through the entire process, from choosing the tech stack to deploying the blog.

## Tech Stack

Here’s the tech stack I used:

- **Static Site Generator:** [Astro](https://astro.build)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- **Hosting:** [Vercel](https://www.netlify.com) (free and easy to use)
- **Code Highlighting:** [Shiki](https://shiki.style) (built into Astro)
